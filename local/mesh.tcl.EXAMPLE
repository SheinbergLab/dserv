# mesh.tcl - Local mesh configuration
#
# Place this file in /usr/local/dserv/local/mesh.tcl to override
# the default seed peer configuration.
#
# This file is sourced instead of mesh_default_seed_config when present,
# allowing per-machine or per-network customization without modifying
# the main meshconf.tcl (which may be overwritten by system updates).

# Configure seeds for this machine/network
#  Add additional seeds as needed:
#  192.168.1.100
#  labserver2.local
mesh_configure_seeds {
    128.148.140.71
}

# Optional: Enable gossip if you want peer-to-peer heartbeats
# meshSetGossip 1

# Optional: Adjust heartbeat interval for this machine
# set mesh_interval 2000
